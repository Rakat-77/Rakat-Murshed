        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>Blind Helper Device</h3>
        <p>Abstract— The paper is about a device which can support blind man for better survival. Blind man can identify his ways by using this device which is used ultrasonic sound reflection system to identify obstacle distance, an Android phone is used to identify objects or obstacle character and Artificial Intelligence(AI) system which can suggest direction to the user also suggest which way is shortages. All system is controlled by embedded system and vibration motors are used for interfacing processing data on the device. Where speed variation of the motors is a data of the device.</p>
        
        <h3>Optical Fiber Waveguide</h3>
        <p>Optical fiber is waveguide that guides signals in the form of light. It is cylindrical in shape and generally made of silica (SiO2) having two different refractive index. The optical fiber would work without the cladding as air also a also lower refractive index than the core glass. However the cladding is useful as it protects the core prevents cross talk and prevents the leakage of light. The difference in refractive index is an important parameter that helps to guide the light inside the fiber core. The signal in the form of light is guided through the optical fiber core based on total internal reflection (TIR) mechanism. Photonic Crystal Fibers (PCFs) have extended the range of capabilities in optical fibers, both by improving well-established properties and introducing new features. PCFs are optical fibers that employ a microstructures arrangement in a background material of different refractive index. The background material is often undoped silica and a low index region is typically provided by air voids running along the length of the fiber. The strong wavelength dependency of the effective refractive index and the inherently large design flexibility of the PCFs allow for a whole new range of novel properties. Such properties include endlessly single-moded fibers, extremely nonlinear fibers and fibers with anomalous dispersion in the visible wavelength region. In this paper, we will obtain high relative sensitivity over a wide range of wavelength by designing hexagonal chemical sensor. Moreover, reducing confinement loss of proposed PCF and investigating sensityvity Accuracy of PCF with Fabricaton tolarence.</p>
        
        <h3>Renewable Energy in Bangladesh</h3>
        <p>Bangladesh is facing daunting challenges for electricity that will exceed domestic supply capabilities within a few years. Oil, Coal and Gas are the traditional sources of Bangladesh. It will be finished within 2100 centuries. But Bangladesh will face the problem immediately. Bangladesh basically depends on gas based electricity. Gas is the mineral sources in Bangladesh. This paper presents a comprehensive study on current energy scenario in Bangladesh and demonstrates the potential of renewable energy resources that could be integrated through national energy planning and therefore, be a step in the right direction for a sustainable development of the country. It will therefore, be necessary to tap all sources of renewable energy and to use these in an efficient converted form for benefit of the people. Primarily this will be done in remote inaccessible un- electrified area in a standalone system where grid expansion is expensive. This energy conversion will reduce pressure on the national power demand. This will not only save excessive grid expansion cost but will also keep environment friendly. Bangladesh is endowed with plentiful supply of renewable sources of energy. Out of various renewable sources solar, biomass, peat, and hydro-power can be effectively used in Bangladesh Renewable energy practices in Bangladesh are: Solar Energy, Wind Energy, Biomass Energy and Hydro-power energy. The interest in renewable energy has been revived over last few years, especially after global awareness regarding the ill effects of fossil fuel burning. Energy is the source of growth and the mover for economic and social development of a nation and its people.</p>
